<h1> Simple Programing Practice</h1>
<hr>

So, the reason behind this repo is just enjoy coding as it is and really just have fun with it. I am hoping to store, some basic codes that I started with, to may be something useful as well. But anyone is free to explore and may be add your own fun code as well or perhaps the code you began your coding journey with. Cheers.
